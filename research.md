My research interests, in the broadest terms, center on the processes controlling energy flow through pelagic ocean ecosystems, from nutrient cycling and primary production through predator/prey interactions and fisheries harvesting. To this end, my work has focused on developing mechanistic modeling techniques that bridge the gap between traditional lower trophic level biogeochemical models and upper trophic level fisheries and ecosystem models.  

In narrower terms, I'm a skilled scientific programmer who's somewhat obsessed with developing robust, thoroughly-tested, and well-documemented ecosystem models and data-dense, intuitive, beautiful data visualizations to explore and convey the internal workings of these ecosystems.  My programming language of choice is Matlab, and I've developed a large library of both highly-specialized and very generic Matlab functions that I share via my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kakearney/) and the [MatlabCentral File Exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?term=authorid%3A287218).  Head over to the blog for more details on this code.
