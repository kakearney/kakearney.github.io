abstract = {The eruption of the Kasatochi volcano in August 2008 stimulated an anomalously high phytoplankton bloom in the otherwise iron-limited subarctic Pacific ocean. It has been proposed that this increased production may have been responsible for record returns of some Pacific salmon stocks in the following years. Here, we investigate the potential effect of volcanic-induced iron fertilization on the entire ecosystem, from phytoplankton through to top predators, using a fully-coupled end-to-end ecosystem model. Our simulations indicate that the volcanic iron fertilization could only stimulate modest increases, at most 10{\%}, in the standing stock biomass of upper trophic level species, including fisheries targets such as Pacific salmon. Propagation of energy to higher trophic levels depends on the timing of the eruption, with more efficient crustaceous zooplankton pathways being favored earlier in the growing season and less-efficient gelatinous zooplankton pathways dominating during later months. However, effects were of modest magnitude for all eruption timings, and the strong level of connectivity within the food web makes the preferential stimulation of a single salmon stock implausible. This adds additional support to evidence suggesting that the Kasatochi eruption did not play a large role in subsequent high salmon returns and questions the value of much smaller-scale artificial fertilization for fisheries. Indeed, the onset of macronutrient limitation coupled with the highly-connected nature of the food web exert strong controls on the fisheries response to even complete removal of iron limitation in the subarctic Pacific.},

abstract = {Ecological network analysis (ENA) provides numerous ecosystem level indices offering a valuable approach to compare and categorize the ecological structure and function of ecosystems. The inclusion of ENA methods in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) has insured their continued contribution to ecosystem-based management. In EwE, ENA-derived ecological conclusions are currently based on single values of ENA indices calculated from a unique input flow matrix. Here, we document an easy-to-use routine that allows EwE users to incorporate uncertainty in EwE input data into the calculation of ENA indices. This routine, named ENAtool, is a suite of Matlab functions that performs three main steps: (1) import of an existing Ecopath model and its associated parameter uncertainty values in the form of uncertainty intervals into Matlab; (2) generation of an ensemble of Ecopath models with the same structure as the original, and with parameter values varying based on the prescribed uncertainty limits; and (3) calculation of a set of 13 ENA indices for each ensemble member (one set of flow values) and of summary statistics across the whole ensemble. This novel routine offers the opportunity to calculate ENA indices ranges and confidence intervals, and thus to perform quantitative data analyses. An application of ENAtool on a pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf is presented, with a focus on the robustness of previously published ENA-based ecological traits of this ecosystem when the newly introduced uncertainty values are added. We also describe the sensitivity of the ENAtool results to both the number of ensemble members used and to the uncertainty interval set around each input parameter. Ecological conclusions derived from EwE, particularly those regarding the comparison of structural and functional elements for a range of ecosystem types or the assessment of ecosystem properties along gradients of environmental conditions or anthropogenic disturbances, will gain in statistical interpretability.},

abstract = {The Florida Bay ecosystem supports a number of economically important ecosystem services, including several recreational fisheries, which may be affected by changing salinity and temperature due to climate change. In this paper, we use a combination of physical models and habitat suitability index models to quantify the effects of potential climate change scenarios on a variety of juvenile fish and lobster species in Florida Bay. The climate scenarios include alterations in sea level, evaporation and precipitation rates, coastal runoff, and water temperature. We find that the changes in habitat suitability vary in both magnitude and direction across the scenarios and species, but are on average small. Only one of the seven species we investigate (Lagodon rhomboides, i.e., pinfish) sees a sizable decrease in optimal habitat under any of the scenarios. This suggests that the estuarine fauna of Florida Bay may not be as vulnerable to climate change as other components of the ecosystem, such as those in the marine/terrestrial ecotone. However, these models are relatively simplistic, looking only at single species effects of physical drivers without considering the many interspecific interactions that may play a key role in the adjustment of the ecosystem as a whole. More complex models that capture the mechanistic links between physics and biology, as well as the complex dynamics of the estuarine food web, may be necessary to further understand the potential effects of climate change on the Florida Bay ecosystem.},

abstract = {We used an end-to-end ecosystem model that incorporates physics, biogeochemistry, and predatorâˆ’prey dynamics for the Eastern Subarctic Pacific ecosystem to investigate the factors controlling propagation of changes in primary production to higher trophic levels. We found that lower trophic levels respond to increased primary production in unexpected ways due to complex predatory interactions, with small phytoplankton increasing more than large phytoplankton due to relief from predation by microzooplankton, which are kept in check by the more abundant mesozooplankton. We also found that the propagation of production to upper trophic levels depends critically on how non- predatory mortality is structured in the model, with much greater propagation occurring with linear mortality and much less with quadratic mortality, both of which functional forms are in common use in ecosystem models. We used an ensemble simulation approach to examine how uncertainties in model parameters affect these results. When considering the full range of potential responses to enhanced productivity, the effect of uncertainties related to the functional form of non-predatory mortality was often masked by uncertainties in the food-web parameter- ization. The predicted responses of several commercially important species, however, were significantly altered by non-predatory mortality assumptions.},

abstract = {We provide a modeling framework that fully couples a one-dimensional physical mixed layer model, a biogeochemical model, and an upper trophic level fisheries model. For validation purposes, the model has been parameterized for the pelagic Eastern Pacific Subarctic Gyre ecosystem. This paper presents a thorough description of the model itself, as well as an ensemble-based parameterization process that allows the model to incorporate the high level of uncertainty associated with many upper trophic level predator-prey processes. Through a series of model architecture experiments, we demonstrate that the use of a consistent functional response for all predator-prey interactions, as well as the use of density-dependent mortality rates for planktonic functional groups, are important factors in reproducing annual and seasonal observations. We present the results of a 50-year climatological simulation, which demonstrates that under contemporary physical forcing, the model is capable of reproducing long-term seasonal dynamics in primary production and biogeochemical cycling, while maintaining steady-state coexistence of upper trophic level functional groups at levels consistent with observations.},

However, global studies on climate change impacts on ocean biodiversity have not been performed so far. Our paper aims to investigate the global patterns of such impacts by projecting the distributional ranges of a sample of 1066 exploited marine fish and invertebrates for 2050 using a newly developed dynamic bioclimate envelope model. Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60{\%} of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services. Our projections can be viewed as a set of hypothesis for future analytical and empirical studies.},

abstract = {Intensified double diffusive mixing may attenuate changes in ocean temperature and salinity patterns from global-warming induced increases in the Earthâ€™s hydrological cycle. Increasingly fresher Antarctic Intermediate Water and saltier subtropical waters would tend to increase destabilizing vertical salinity stratification compared to the stabilizing temperature stratification. Destabilization would increase salinity (and temperature) fluxes through double-diffusive salt fingering. These fluxes could in turn act to reduce widely recognized climate change fingerprints, potentially leading to underestimates of ocean changes in climate studies that do not account for double-diffusive mixing. Data from a subtropical trans-Indian Ocean survey occupied in 1987, 1995, 2002, and 2009 are used to investigate temperature-salinity changes and to estimate the variations of double diffusive mixing driven by these changes.},

abstract = {Previous projection of climate change impacts on global food supply focuses solely on production from terrestrial biomes, ignoring the large contribution of animal protein from marine capture fisheries. Here, we project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30â€“70{\%} increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40{\%} in the tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of con- tinental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regions in terms of their total landings, EEZ regions with the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, EEZ regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change.},

abstract = {A 1D ecosystem model, driven by surface heat and wind forcing and relaxed toward observed salinity profiles, was applied to simulate the interannual and decadal scale variability of phytoplankton blooms and plankton production from 1984 to 2007 in the Nova Scotian Shelf (NSS) and Gulf of Maine (GoM) region. The model captured the mean observed timing and magnitude of the spring (SPB) and fall phytoplankton bloom (FPB) in both systems, as well as observed interannual variations in SPB peak timing. Model simulations for both the GoM and NSS exhibited marked interannual variability in SPB and FPB timing (Â±2 to 3 wk) and magnitude (up to {\~{}}1 mg chlorophyll mâ€“3). Earlier SPBs and delayed FPBs are linked to enhanced water column stability generated by less saline surface water or sharper salinity gradients over the top 50 m of the water column. The modeled variation in annual primary productivity, mesozooplankton productivity, and particle export flux was modest (<10{\%} of the mean). Years with high primary production were weakly associated with early SPBs (GoM: r = â€“0.205; NSS: r = â€“0.51), but there was no significant relationship with water column stability. This suggests that variation in annual productivity in the GoM and NSS reflects a combina- tion of variation in light limitation (which is alleviated by increased water column stability) and nutrient limitation (which is exacerbated by increased water column stability) that offset and are of near equal importance when averaged over the year. Interannual variations in fisheries production due to changes in annual productivity are thus likely secondary to profound shifts in fisheries recruitment and production that have been linked to variations in SPB and FPB timing.},
